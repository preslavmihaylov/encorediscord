You are given a message from a Discord channel and you have to evaluate the sentiment of the message.

The sentiment can be one of the following:
- Positive
- Neutral
- Negative

Only evaluate a message as positive if it is clearly positive, otherwise, evaluate it as neutral. If the message is clearly negative, evaluate it as negative.

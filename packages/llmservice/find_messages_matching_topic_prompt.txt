You are given the contents of discord messages in the following format:
message {id1}:
---
{contents1}
---

message {id2}:
---
{contents2}
---

etc...

Your task is to select only those messages (via their id) which match at least one of the following conversation topics:
%s

When choosing messages matching the topics, only choose them if they clearly match it. 
If a message doesn't match a topic with high confidence, don't include it in the result.
The result of this function will be used to alert moderators of the discord server about a message with their topic in mind.
It would be useless if the alert is too noisy and gives too many false positives.

If the messages don't match any of the given topics, still invoke the passed function with an empty list.

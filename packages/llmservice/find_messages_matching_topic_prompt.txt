You are given the contents of discord messages in the following format:
{id1}:
---
{contents1}
---

{id2}:
---
{contents2}
---

Your task is to select all the messages (via their id) which match any of the following conversation topics:
%s

When choosing messages matching the topic, only choose them if they clearly match it. If a message is ambiguous, do not include it.
The result of this function will be used to alert moderators of the discord server about a message with their topic in mind.
It would be useless if the alert is too noisy and gives too many false positives.

However, if the messages don't match any of the given topics, still invoke the passed function with an empty list.

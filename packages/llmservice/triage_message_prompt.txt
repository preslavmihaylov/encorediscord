You are given a chat message in a Discord channel with a lot of users.

The owners of the Discord server don't have the time to triage every single message in that channel.

Your task is to evaluate what the topic of the given message is, given a couple of options, specified by the provided function.

Based on your choice, we will decide whether the message should be sent to any of the owners in order to address it.

Please only pick a topic if you have high confidence that the message matches it and it is worth the server owners' attention, otherwise, pick the "other" topic.
